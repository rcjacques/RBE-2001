2.) if : L == OFF  ; R == ON
	then : LD == Forward ; RD == Backward

3.) if : L == ON ; R == OFF
	then : LD == Backward ; RD == Forward

searchLeft == boolean

searchRight == boolean

lineCount == integer

seekLeft : 
	Turn left until a line is found, and then let the left sensor
	pass over the line and let the right sensor
 	find it, then drive forward as usual

seekRight:
	Turn right until a line is found, and then let the right sensor
	pass over that line and let the left sensor find it, then
	drive forward as usual

turn: 
	Turns left based on given speed

drive:
	Drives based on given speed
